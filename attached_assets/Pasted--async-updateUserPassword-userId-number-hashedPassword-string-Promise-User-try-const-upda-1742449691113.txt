Could you please let me know what specific feature or improvement you'd like to implement in this content management system? This will help me create an appropriate plan tailored to your needs.

Can you look at the deployment logs? It looks like we might be having an error here with our async update password. I just pasted some code, the assistant debugged and said it looks like we have a duplicate of our implementation for updating the user password. We need to look at that and make sure it's all set up properly.

Remove duplicate implementation of `updateUserPassword` function.

Could you verify if the password reset functionality is working properly? Try resetting a password to check if it works.

Looking at the deployment logs and your code, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

The server is currently hardcoded to listen on port 5000 without using the PORT environment variable that Cloud Run provides
There's an unnecessary secondary port mapping in .replit that should be removed
