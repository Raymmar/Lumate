You can see that the previous and next cursor are the same which is why we are getting the same information back each time. We need to try something new here to get a new updated next cursor 

Maybe stop putting the usr number in our direct query. 

We should be making a generic query to - 
https://api.lu.ma/public/v1/calendar/list-people with no parameters related to count or users and just use the response to shape our next request so we can paginate through all responses without duplicates. 

We should also be sure we time out our efforts when we get back a few tries without any new data so we do not get stuck in an endless loop.
