I am trying to set up a file upload using the replit object storage bucket. I have an ID and a bucket set up, but I am not sure how to configure it on the back end.

Can you inspect my setup and provide some guidance based on Replit documentation and the replit object store library?

I see this message. Does this present a problem?

This library supports Bun, Deno, and Node.js. It is not recommended for browser-based applications.

For more information, see the SDK Reference.

What is going on here? no need to write any code, just want to talk through this and think through the process

I've reviewed your FileUploadService and your Replit Object Storage setup. Let me explain what's happening and how it works.

Looking at your server/services/FileUploadService.ts, I can see you're already using Replit's database client for object storage with this line:

this.replDb = new (createClient as any)();
The warning message you're seeing is normal and just indicates that the Object Storage library is designed for server-side use (which is exactly how you're using it), not for direct use in browser-based applications.

Here's what's going on:

Your setup is correct - you're importing the Replit database client and using it to store files in your bucket.

In your storage flow:

You generate a unique filename
You save the file buffer to the object storage with this.replDb.set(key, file.buffer)
You create a public URL using the bucket ID: https://${this.bucketId}.id.repl.co/${key}
The bucket ID is properly configured from your environment variable REPLIT_DEFAULT_BUCKET_ID.

Your .replit file correctly has the Object Storage configuration:

[objectStorage]
defaultBucketID = "replit-objstore-fdb314e8-358e-4080-9f92-57e210181986"
This is the proper way to use Replit's Object Storage. The server handles the upload and then returns the URL to the client, which is the recommended approach rather than having the browser directly upload to the bucket.

No issues with your implementation - it follows best practices for handling file uploads with Replit's Object Storage. The warning message is just clarifying that the library should be used server-side (which you are doing correctly) rather than directly from browser JavaScript.

Ok, great, however the file upload is not working. So there is some kind of error along the route. What are we missing here? There must be some kind of missing dependency or something else getting in the way

Looking at your FileUploadService implementation, I can see an issue with the import for @replit/database. The problem is that you're using createClient from this library but didn't import it correctly.

Let's fix the import in your FileUploadService.ts file:

server/services/FileUploadService.ts
You're using the wrong package for object storage. The @replit/database package is for Replit's key-value database, but for object storage (file uploads), you need to use the @replit/object-storage package.

Let's also correct the instantiation of the client in the constructor:

And let's update the upload and delete methods to use the correct API for the object storage client:

These changes should fix the issue with your file upload functionality. The key problems were:

Using the wrong package (@replit/database instead of @replit/object-storage)
Not correctly instantiating the client
Using incorrect methods for file operations (set instead of uploadFromBuffer)

Ok, it seems to be working, however the app still fails to load the image preview and when I try to access the image URL, I see it is not actually hosted. When I look at my bucket, I do not see any new uploaded files. Are we sure we have the proper bucket set up in the env file with secure routing?

This is the ID we should be using - replit-objstore-fdb314e8-358e-4080-9f92-57e210181986

Looking at the logs, I can see that the file upload process is actually working correctly. The server logs show:

File uploaded successfully: {
  key: 'uploads/20806fbd-c4e1-4730-a020-9d330a0635cb.jpeg',
  url: 'https://replit-objstore-fdb314e8-358e-4080-9f92-57e210181986.id.repl.co/uploads/20806fbd-c4e1-4730-a020-9d330a0635cb.jpeg'
}
The bucket ID in the URL matches the one you specified. The issue might be related to CORS permissions or how the client is handling the image preview.

Let's check two things:

Ensure the bucket ID is correctly set in your environment variables
Verify the browser can access the file URL directly
Let's properly set the bucket ID in an environment variable:

echo "REPLIT_DEFAULT_BUCKET_ID=replit-objstore-fdb314e8-358e-4080-9f92-57e210181986" > .env
Now, let's modify the FileUploadService to include proper headers for CORS:

server/services/FileUploadService.ts
Let's also add a simple test endpoint to verify the object storage connection:

server/routes.ts
Let's also make sure the client-side is correctly displaying the uploaded images:

After applying these changes, visit /api/storage-test in your browser to verify the object storage connection is working properly.

If you still have issues after these changes, it could be that:

The bucket may have specific access permissions that need to be configured in the Replit dashboard
There might be a network issue preventing external access to the bucket
