To process a Stripe success URL link, you need to: capture the Checkout Session ID embedded in the URL, retrieve the corresponding session details from your Stripe server using that ID, and then display a custom success page on your website with relevant order information from the retrieved session; essentially, you are using the success URL provided by Stripe to verify a successful payment and display a confirmation page to the customer with details about their purchase. 
Key steps:
Set up a success URL when creating a Checkout Session:
When you initiate a Stripe Checkout session, specify a "success_url" parameter that points to a page on your website where you want the customer to be redirected after a successful payment.
Extract the Checkout Session ID from the URL:
When the customer is redirected to the success URL, your server-side code will need to extract the Checkout Session ID from the URL query parameters.
Retrieve Session Details from Stripe:
Using the Stripe API, fetch the Checkout Session details from your server by providing the extracted Session ID.
Render a custom success page:
Based on the retrieved session information (like customer details, payment amount, items purchased), dynamically render a custom success page on your website displaying the order confirmation. 
Important points to consider:
Security:
Always validate the Checkout Session ID on your server to prevent malicious attempts. 
Error handling:
Implement logic to handle situations where the session is not found or the payment fails. 
Customizing the success page:
You can tailor the success page with specific information relevant to your business, like order number, shipping details, and download links if applicable. 
Example code snippet (using Node.js with Express):
Code

app.get('/success', async (req, res) => {

  const sessionId = req.query.session_id;

  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.retrieve(sessionId);



  // Render a success page with details from the session

  res.render('success', { 

    customerEmail: session.customer_email,

    orderAmount: session.amount_total,

    // ... other relevant details

  });

});
