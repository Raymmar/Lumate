The Story of Sarasota Tech
How we got here
Early in May of 2023 a few friends started talking about how to connect with folks from the broader tech community in Sarasota. 
A couple weeks later we organized "â€‹Drinky Thinkyâ€‹". A casual happy hour at State street. 6 people showed up.

We never planned to start a formal meetup that day, but we all walked away thinking "we should do this again"! So we told everyone to watch their email and next time "bring a friend".

Our next event drew 12 attendees. Then 35. Then 65. 
A few months later we hosted our first Tech JAM and 130 people showed up! ðŸ¤¯
Word was spreading across the region and people were driving from as far as Tampa, Orlando, Naples and even Miami to attend our events.

Since then we have hosted 22 events with more than 2,000 attendees. Including our first ever sold out â€‹Tech Summitâ€‹ which brought in more than 300 people from across the region.

It has been one heck of a ride so far and we're excited to see where this adventure takes us next. 
ðŸš€ Thank you for being a part our story and helping us bring this vision to life!
