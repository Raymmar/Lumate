Tech J.A.M???
A playful acronym for a serious mission.
Many of our early planning discussions were focused on how this group might evolve over the years to come. 
We saw this as an opportunity to leverage technology to give back to the community in creative ways. 
Which is where the idea of a J.A.M. came from. 
J.A.M. stands for Just Another Meetup and is intended to be a flexible umbrella under which we can host any number of events. 
Our mission is to use technology to connect the Sarasota Community while increasing visibility for local talent and businesses in the region.

We've talked about hosting an "ART J.A.M." or some type of "J.A.M. Sessions". You might even see us try our hand at live music events, startup pitch nights or panel discussions with business/community leaders. 
Honestly the sky is the limit as we step into the next chapter of this organization and think about how to leverage the momentum we are building. 
As we grow, we hope to foster a spirit of collaboration across the region while showing off the hidden creative talent that makes Sarasota so special. 
Sometimes that means our events will be fully tech-forward. Other times that means our tech will be supporting other organizations and initiatives behind the scenes. 
Be sure to bookmark the ‚ÄãSarasota.Tech‚Äã website and check back often as it evolves into a powerful community resource and home base for all of our digital operations. 
Anyway, that is all for now! üëãüèΩ
